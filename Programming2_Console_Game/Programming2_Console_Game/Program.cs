//  Create NPC: When this command is called, ask for the name of the NPC and create an NPC object with a randomly generated position on a 100 x 100 grid and randomly
generated type and backstory values (the type and backstory should be related). A maximum of 5 NPC objects can be created.

3. Shoot: When this command is called, ask for the name of the NPC to shoot. If the NPC is within distance, is an enemy and has health points remaining, then reduce their
health by 1. If the NPC is a friend, then reduce the players health points by 2. When an enemy’s health reaches 0, the enemy is dead. Each time an enemy is killed,
the status of all friends and enemies has to be checked to determine if the game is over.

        4. Move: When this command is called, ask for a new position, update the players position and reduce their health by 1.

5. Query NPC: When this command is called, ask for an NPC’s name and print the NPC’s
backstory.

6. Request Alliance: When this command is called, ask for the NPC’s name. If the NPC’s type is enemy, then the player loses 2 health points and their allegiance status
is set to “enemy”. If the NPC’s type is friend, then their allegiance status is set to “friend”.

7. Print Player Status: When this command is called, print the current status of the player.This should include the players health value, ammunition value and position.

 8. Print NPC Status: When this commend is called, print the current status of all NPCs. This should include health values, their allegiance status and their distance
 from the player.*/
